4 October 2023
from meeting with Vicente and Reagan
- Reagan created an alignment file called exons_blastn.fasta, which contains the aligned results from a blastn he did where he independently looked for the three different exons accross all of the frog genomes on Genbank.
- We then used AliView to develop primers, and Randy will finish this up and select three primer sets to get the three exons for Ranid species
- Reagan will look at where the different Ranid species with genomic data live and categorize them as "cold" and "not cold", then look at the nucleotide frequency between these.

from meeting with Vicente and Reagan
- Get exon 1 for other taxa that are lacking it in the tblast_alignments.fasta file (see blastn results), add these to the tblast_alignments.fasta file and save this as a new file called "consensus_alignment.fasta" 
- Get exon 1 and 3 for Nanorana (and any others that have them missing) by looking at the genome itself (use the exon 2 location, and crop genome on several thousand bp on either end to include exon 1 and 3. You can then search for these using blast.
- Merge sequences for individual taxa so there is a single sequence for each taxon
- Keep working on finding primers; specifically, look for 3 sets of primers: (1) primers for exon 1, (2) primers for exon 2, (3) primers for exon 3
- Reagan was trying tblast with the whole genetic region (the 3 exons and their two large introns)
--- This is based on a hunch that their may be alternative splicing
--- Let's not focus on alternative splicing for now, but keep this in mind and look at it later


18 September 2023
from meeting with Vicente and Reagan
- Look for first 15 aa in sylvaticus genome: where are they located? Reagan will work on this
- Try to find primers. Try blast-short, but also look at highly-conserved sequences at the beginning and end of the loci that hit.
- Vicente will fill in latitude/elevation data

15 September 2023
From meeting with Randy and Vicente
- Take time to do plural sight tutorial on using pandas (python package)
- Work on adding elevation/latitude data to the Ranidae_latitude_and_elevation spreadsheet
-- Use ranid_data_curation.py script as a starting point to mess with pandas (you can modify this however you want)

8 September 2023
From meeting with Vicente:
- Get new database from vertnet that includes all Ranidae specimens (not just tissues)
--  This will provide more info on lat/long and elevation
- Use pandas to find lat/long and elevation info from the new vertnet database

28 August 2023
1. Vicente- add Lithobates species to maps, and additional Rana species
2. Reagan- get amino acid sequences from the four species
-- We need to go into the genome to do this- there may be an intron...
3. Reagan and Vicente- figure out pandas (tutorial: https://github.com/joaks1/python-tabular-data)
-- Goal with pandas: pull out all of the taxa of interest and put them into a csv
4. For next time (or if Randy has time), design primers

19 June 2023
1. Update CatPop github documentation to include exact coding steps
   (example code: https://github.com/KLab-UT/CHPC-intro/blob/main/README.md)
2. Download reference frog genomes to scratch DONE!
   /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/fr10_evolution_wd/reference_genomes
3. Create blast database for reference genomes in scratch CURRENTLY RUNNING!
   scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/fr10_evolution_wd/blast_db
4. Generate blast output in scratch READY TO GO!
   /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/fr10_evolution_wd/blast_outputs

-----------------------


1. Create summary of blast results to all genomes. Within summary, include this:
a. If a genome got a hit
b. How many hits each genome got
c. what is the gene that got hit and what is its e-value for the hit
   --- Many of the genes may not have gene names, but you can check by taking the sequence of the subject (the match on the reference) and blasting it to find out what it is. To get the sequence of the reference seq, change the -outfmt to -outfmt "7 qseqid sseqid evalue qstart qend sstart send sseq".
