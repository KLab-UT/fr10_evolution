1. Vicente- add Lithobates species to maps, and additional Rana species
2. Reagan- get amino acid sequences from the four species
-- We need to go into the genome to do this- there may be an intron...
3. Reagan and Vicente- figure out pandas (tutorial: https://github.com/joaks1/python-tabular-data)
-- Goal with pandas: pull out all of the taxa of interest and put them into a csv
4. For next time (or if Randy has time), design primers

1. Update CatPop github documentation to include exact coding steps
   (example code: https://github.com/KLab-UT/CHPC-intro/blob/main/README.md)
2. Download reference frog genomes to scratch DONE!
   /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/fr10_evolution_wd/reference_genomes
3. Create blast database for reference genomes in scratch CURRENTLY RUNNING!
   scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/fr10_evolution_wd/blast_db
4. Generate blast output in scratch READY TO GO!
   /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/fr10_evolution_wd/blast_outputs

-----------------------


1. Create summary of blast results to all genomes. Within summary, include this:
a. If a genome got a hit
b. How many hits each genome got
c. what is the gene that got hit and what is its e-value for the hit
   --- Many of the genes may not have gene names, but you can check by taking the sequence of the subject (the match on the reference) and blasting it to find out what it is. To get the sequence of the reference seq, change the -outfmt to -outfmt "7 qseqid sseqid evalue qstart qend sstart send sseq".
